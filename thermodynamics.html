 <!-- Notice that it is valid to use a metric to compare vectors in different spaces
      in as long as they are related by an isometry. In this case, the metric is cartesian and the 
      propagator is an isometry because it is unitary. -->
  
 <!-- Extra...
      For adiabatic dynamics there are no level crossings,  therefore the dim and orientation of the time-
      evolved Hilbert space,  gen(U(t)psi_1(0), U(t)psi_2(0),...), is preserved all along. For non-adiabatic
      dynamics only dim is preserved, and this, provided there are no phase transitions. Since both are vector
      spaces, preserving the dimensionality is enough for the existence of an isomorphism (yet not always
      preserving orientation) and therefore the metric lives in the non-orientable plane formed by the 
      cartesian product of time-evolved Hilbert spaces.  The Hilbert spaces involving level crossings
      are not part of this manyfold because they are unstable with respect to perturbations of the driving
      parameter (unlike phase transitions).
  
      A phase transition
      changes the dimensionality of the Hilbert space because brings ignored (RG irrelevant) degrees of 
      freedom into the relevant scale of energy, in which the Hilbert space (itself a truncated representation
      of an otherwise infinite system) is defined.
  
      A fiber bundle is a space that is locally a product space e.g. locally isomorphic to E1 x E2 x E3,
      the latter being not necessarily linear spaces. If the product is between ismorphic space then it is a 
      special type of fiber bundle, say a manyfold. If the product is between vector spaces that are isomorphic 
      then it is a Riemann manyfold (am I right, maybe names are not right but there is probably a name for each
      of these cases). -->
